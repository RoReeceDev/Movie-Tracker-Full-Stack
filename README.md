## How It's Made

** Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, MongoDB

### Project Overview
I built this movie tracking application to provide users with a simple and intuitive way to organize their movie preferences. Users can easily add movies to their "To Watch" list and dynamically update the status of each movie using the "watched," "watching," or "dropped" buttons/icons.

### Implementation Details
The front end is crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while EJS templates enhance the dynamic rendering of movie data. Node.js powers the backend, and MongoDB serves as the database to store user movie lists and statuses.

One of the challenges I faced during development was efficiently shifting movie items between lists without duplication. Through careful debugging and refining, I successfully implemented a solution that ensures a seamless transition of movies between different user-defined categories.
